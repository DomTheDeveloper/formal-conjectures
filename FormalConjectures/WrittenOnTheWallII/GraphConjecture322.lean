WOWII [Conjecture 322](http://cms.dt.uh.edu/faculty/delavinae/research/wowII/)

Let `G` be a simple connected graph on `n ≥ 5` vertices. If the maximum over all
vertices `v` of `l(v)` — the independence number of the neighborhood `N(v)` of `v`
— is at most 1, then `G` is well totally dominated.

Here `l(v) = α(G[N(v)])` is the independence number of the subgraph induced by the
open neighborhood of `v`.
