# Formal polynomial integration for the Geode moment recurrence

The moment proof only needs integration of a polynomial in `t` from zero to one.
We define that operation algebraically, coefficient by coefficient, over
`Polynomial ℚ`. This avoids importing analytic integration and makes the
integration-by-parts argument available over exact rational coefficients.
